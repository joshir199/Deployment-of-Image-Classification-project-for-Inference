# Features and properties of FastAPI as a powerful tool for developing high-performance APIs in Python

"""
1. FastAPI is a Python Web Framework:

  FastAPI is a modern web framework for building web APIs in Python.
  It's designed to simplify the process of creating APIs by providing a set of tools,
  utilities, and conventions that make API development faster and more straightforward.

2. Optimized for Building APIs:

   FastAPI is specifically optimized for building APIs. Unlike some other web frameworks
   that can be used for various types of web applications (e.g., web pages, APIs, and more),
   FastAPI focuses primarily on making API development efficient and productive.

3. Uses Python Type Hints:

   Python type hints are annotations that specify the types of variables, function arguments,
   and return values in your code. FastAPI leverages Python type hints extensively to automatically
    generate documentation, perform data validation, and improve code quality.

   This feature allows developers to write strongly-typed APIs, making it easier to catch errors
   early in the development process.

4. Built-in Support for Async Operations:

   FastAPI natively supports asynchronous programming using Python's async and await keywords.
   This means you can write asynchronous code to handle I/O-bound operations efficiently.
   Asynchronous programming is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to handle many
   concurrent requests without blocking the server.

5. Built on Top of Starlette and Pydantic:

  FastAPI is not built entirely from scratch; it builds upon two other libraries:

      # Starlette: Starlette is a lightweight ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) framework for
                 building asynchronous web applications. FastAPI uses Starlette as its ASGI server, which
                 provides the foundation for handling HTTP requests and responses.

      # Pydantic: Pydantic is a data validation and parsing library for Python. FastAPI uses Pydantic for
                request and response data validation and parsing. It makes it easy to define and enforce
                data schemas for API endpoints, ensuring that the data is well-formed and adheres to the
                expected structure.

6. Very Performant:

   FastAPI is known for its high performance. It is designed to handle a large number of
   requests efficiently, thanks to its asynchronous capabilities and optimized code generation.
   It's a good choice for building APIs that need to handle heavy traffic and maintain low latency.
